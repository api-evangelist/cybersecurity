    We'll keep track of interesting images and alert you when something happens.
    We're starting off with basic motion detection. We keep the images around
    and organize them by time and day. We'll send you an email or a text message
    if you'd like when we detect something. Heading out of town for the weekend?
    Leave your camera pointed at the front door. If someone comes in, we'll text
    you. You can also share your cameras with your friends or the whole world.
    We encourage sharing, but it's best not to share cameras located in ultra
    private spaces. Sorry, we don't allow adult content on our site. There are
    plenty of other places on the Internet if you're looking for that kind of
    stuff.
